# Project Description

A batched data-extraction pipeline using `databricks-sql-connector`. 
The result is 6 analysis ready tables focused on interpolated column values.

`job_role = "%Data%"`  

`country = "United States of America""`

### Skills

Exercise the ability to design a batch-oriented Python
workflow that materialized production datasets into 
owned, analysis-ready artifacts using CTAS and algorithmic thinking.

### Next Steps

The next step for this project will be to drop these `.csv` artifacts
into GPT and Claude, and have them generate business 
challenge questions to help me further build my ability
to handle complex problems with SQL queries.
